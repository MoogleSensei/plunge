# Plunge
Plunge is a simple start to a game where you play as the scuba-diving white square on a mission to collect 1,000,000 treasure. Your superiors have demanded you collect as least that much treasure just to make this expedition worth it, though the more you collect, the better you will be paid. Try to pad your own pockets as much as possible as you plumb the depths for treasure!

Graphics are minimal "programmer graphics" and there is no sound or music.

## How to Play
Use the left arrow key, the 'a' key, or left-click on your mouse to select the left option when options are displayed on the bottom of the screen or to dive down and to the left.

Use the right arrow key, the 'd' key, or right-click on your mouse to select the right option when options are displayed on the bottom of the screen or to dive down and to the right.

When diving, you can press the button quickly to dive a small amount or hold it to dive longer.

Fortunately your superiors have seen fit to offer you better gear that should make collecting mountains of treasure a piece of cake! Unfortunately, it's going to cost you, and you'll be starting out with the worst gear possible.

In order to shop for gear upgrades, simply float up to the surface (or to your submarine) on the right end of the screen.

There are also hazards floating around in the water. Angry, possessive fish will bite a chunk out of you if they get close enough. The amount of health you have left will be displayed at the top of the screen.

To recover precious health, simply rise to the surface in the middle of the screen. At least you are getting the best healthcare possible!

If it all proves to be too much for you to handle, you can quit by rising to the surface in the left end of the screen.

Despite all the hazards and lofty, corporate goals, try to have fun as you plunge into the depths on a great search for treasure, thanks for playing!

## Tips
It is recommended that you upgrade your flippers first, as they provide the greatest advantage in maneuverability.

The submarine upgrades are not necessary to collect 1,000,000 treasure, though they will help immensely.

Rumor has it that the amount of treasure floating around increases drastically at depths below 10,000.

There is a channel of safe water on the right side of the screen that you can use to float upwards without having to worry about running into any enemies.
